Typical game played by Russian inmates and ex-convicts, Bura is popular card game
played from 2 to 6 people using a deck of 36 cards. Unconventional among point-trick
games, Bura allows the possibility of leading a number of cards at once given their
suits are identical.



How to play:

The game is played using 36-card deck. At the beginning 3 cards are dealt out to each
of the players and the card, determining the trump suit, is displayed. A valid move for
a player, initiating a move, consists of any combination of cards of the same suit
(a combination of 3 aces, one of which is of trump suit, is also valid, and is called
a golden bura). A player, responding to his opponent, has 2 options: either beat his
cards (take a bribe) or give up the corresponding number of any cards in his hand. In
the case when a player gives up cards, his opponent is said to have taken a bribe. After
that cards are dealt out to players until each of them has 3 cards in hand. A player, who
has taken the last bribe, initiates the next move. The game finishes when there are no
cards left in deck and players' hands. The score of each player is calculated according
to his cards' points in bribes, following the rule: Ace - 11 points, 10 - 10 points,
King - 4 points, Queen - 3 points, Jack - 2 points, and 6, 7, 8, 9 have no value. In this
game the order of ranks (ascending) is: 6, 7, 8, 9, Jack, Queen, King, 10, Ace.
